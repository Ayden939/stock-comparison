# STOCK MARKET DATA WRANGLING PROJECT

**Project Overview**  
This project focuses on cleaning data, tranforming it, and analyzing it using python. In this project I focus on determining if there is a significant correlation or relationship between stocks.

**Dataset**  
The file used is stocks.csv, which has historical stock data over a subset of a few specific stocks.  

**Tools**  
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
  
**Workflow**
1. Load the data using Pandas
2. Clean the data by using datetime format and handling missing data
3. Group transactions by month
4. Aggregate the data
5. Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create graphs/charts representing the data
6. Use linear regression to detect correlation between stock prices

**Run Instructions**
1. Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/Ayden939/stock-data-wrangling.git
2. Open the Jupyter file (Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code), and you can run it step by step
